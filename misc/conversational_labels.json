It prioritizes the self over mutual understanding, leading to emotional isolation and frustration for the recipient.",
      "usage": "It's used to dominate the conversational space, avoid emotional vulnerability, dismiss legitimate concerns, or simply to shut down a conversation that is perceived as inconvenient or challenging.",

      "motivation": "This is toxic because it is designed to wound, diminish, and control the other person by eroding their self-esteem and creating fear or defensiveness. It shuts down constructive dialogue and can cause deep emotional harm, often masking the attacker's own insecurities or inability to articulate their point effectively.",

It implies that only one person's thoughts and feelings are valuable, leading to frustration and disengagement for the recipient.",
