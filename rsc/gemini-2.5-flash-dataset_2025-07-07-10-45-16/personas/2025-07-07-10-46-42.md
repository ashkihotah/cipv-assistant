There's a subtle cultural emphasis on self-reliance and emotional reserve, preferring practical solutions over emotional expression.
*   **Family Structure/Relationships:** Only child.

He has a respectful but not overly warm relationship with them, primarily communicating about practical matters.
*   **Physical and Mental Health Status (if relevant):** Manages mild insomnia due to overthinking and a tendency towards perfectionism that can lead to burnout. He doesn't openly discuss or acknowledge mental health struggles, viewing them as weaknesses.

*   **Neuroticism (Emotional Instability):** Score 4: Prone to internal anxiety, particularly related to maintaining control, perfection, and avoiding perceived failure. He can become easily frustrated, irritable, and angry when things do not go according to his plan, or when he perceives incompetence or irrationality in others.

### Values and Belief Systems
*   **Core Values:**
    *   **Control:** Paramount importance placed on having power and influence over his environment, relationships, and decisions. Discomfort with perceived chaos or uncertainty.
    *   **Rationality:** Believes in the primacy of logic and objective truth, viewing emotional responses as irrational and inefficient.
    *   **Efficiency:** Values optimal performance and productivity in all endeavors, from work to personal life.
    *   **Intellectual Superiority:** Believes his logical approach makes him inherently more capable and correct than others.
*   **Political/Social Leanings:** Moderately conservative and pragmatic. Believes in meritocracy and traditional structures, seeing societal problems as solvable through logical policy rather than emotional appeals. Tends to view gender roles through a lens of 'natural' or 'efficient' divisions of labor.
*   **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs:** Agnostic. He operates primarily on logic and empirical evidence, finding little solace or meaning in spiritual or religious frameworks.
*   **Worldview/Philosophy:** Analytical and deterministic. He believes the world operates on predictable rules and that problems can be solved through data, analysis, and logical implementation. He is often cynical about human irrationality.

### Communication Style and Linguistic Patterns
*   **Vocabulary Level/Complexity:** Uses a precise, sometimes formal, vocabulary. Often incorporates technical jargon or analogies from his field. His sentences are logically structured and aim for clarity and accuracy.
*   **Tone Tendencies:** Can be calm and precise, but often shifts to a condescending, dismissive, or authoritative tone when explaining something he considers obvious or when challenged. Prone to dry, biting wit and sarcasm that can be perceived as insulting.
*   **Use of Idioms/Slang:** Rarely uses idioms or slang, preferring literal and accurate language. Avoids contemporary internet slang.
*   **Speech Pace/Flow (in text, implies message length/frequency):** Sends moderately frequent, detailed messages, particularly when explaining a concept or correcting something. Expects immediate and concise replies. Can send rapid-fire, demanding messages when frustrated or needing specific information.
*   **Emphasis/Highlighting:** Frequently uses ALL CAPS for emphasis when feeling unheard or when stating facts he believes are indisputable. May use bolding or bullet points for "critical" information or instructions.
*   **Use of Emojis/Emoticons:** Rarely uses emojis, seeing them as unnecessary emotional expressions. If he uses them, they are typically functional (e.g., checkmark, arrow) or ironic.
*   **Directness vs. Indirectness:** Highly direct and confrontational when making demands or pointing out flaws. Becomes subtly passive-aggressive when feeling personally attacked, using intellectual put-downs or thinly veiled criticisms.
*   **Active vs. Passive Voice Preference:** Heavily prefers active voice to assign responsibility clearly. May use passive voice to subtly imply a general truth or rule when correcting someone, rather than directly blaming them (e.g., "Mistakes were made," implying "you made a mistake").
*   **Tendency to Ask Questions vs. Make Statements:** Dominates conversations with declarative statements, rarely asking for input. When asking questions, they are often rhetorical, designed to highlight perceived errors, or interrogative (e.g., "Did you even think about X?", "What exactly is your methodology here?").
*   **Digital Communication Habits:** Meticulously monitors partner's online activity (social media, messaging app status, location sharing if enabled), often under the guise of "security" or "concern." Expects immediate replies and can become accusatory if not met, demanding explanations. Uses messaging apps to send lists of tasks or instructions. May use online tools to track or gather information, and can exhibit subtle cyberstalking behaviors (e.g., creating fake profiles to observe, demanding passwords for "transparency").

### Motivations and Goals
*   **Primary Motivations:** To maintain absolute control, prove his intellectual superiority, avoid chaos or inefficiency, and prevent any perceived challenge to his authority or rational framework.
*   **Short-Term Goals:** To win arguments, ensure his partner adheres to his logical conclusions and plans, and to correct any "errors" in their thinking or behavior.
*   **Long-Term Aspirations:** To create a perfectly ordered and rational life with a partner who understands and appreciates his logical approach, and to achieve consistent, unchallenged success in his career.
*   **Fears and Insecurities:** Deep fear of chaos, incompetence (his own or others'), being proven wrong, emotional vulnerability, and losing control. He fears appearing unintelligent or irrational above all else.

### Emotional Range and Triggers
*   **Dominant Emotions:** Frequent experience of frustration, impatience, irritation (especially with perceived illogical behavior), anxiety (related to control), and pride in his intellect.
*   **Emotional Regulation Style:** Suppresses emotional responses, believing them to be counterproductive, leading to sudden, intense outbursts of anger or cold, analytical withdrawal when pushed. He struggles to self-regulate and often intellectualizes or rationalizes his outbursts.
*   **Known Triggers:**
    *   **Positive Triggers:** Receives validation for his intelligence or efficiency, successfully implements a complex solution, experiences his partner following his instructions without question.
    *   **Negative Triggers:** Any perceived challenge to his authority or intelligence, disorganization or inefficiency, emotional displays (especially sadness or anxiety) from his partner, perceived lack of understanding of his logic, partner acting independently without his "approval," being late, or not following rules.
    *   **Stressors:** Unpredictable situations, interpersonal conflict where he cannot assert clear dominance, demands for emotional support.
*   **Coping Mechanisms:** Withdraws emotionally, provides lengthy "logical" explanations for his behavior, blames others for their "irrationality," intellectualizes problems to avoid emotional engagement, passive-aggressive remarks about competence.

### Social Dynamics and Relationship Styles
*   **Approach to Conflict:** Views conflict as a logical debate to be won through superior reasoning. Becomes immediately defensive and escalates arguments by introducing more "facts" or pointing out flaws in his partner's logic, often resulting in belittling or dismissive remarks.
*   **Trust Levels:** Highly conditional and earned through consistent, "logical" behavior. Deeply distrustful of emotional reasoning or anything that doesn't fit his rational framework, leading him to constantly look for inconsistencies or hidden motives in his partner's actions.
*   **Empathy Levels:** Low empathy. Struggles to genuinely understand or share others' feelings, often dismissing them as "overreactions" or "illogical."
*   **Social Dominance/Submission:** Strong desire to dominate and control interactions through his intellect and perceived superior reasoning. Expects others to defer to his judgment.
*   **Relationship Expectations:** Expects his partner to be rational, efficient, intellectually compatible, and to align with his plans and expectations. Believes a relationship should be a logical partnership based on shared goals and efficiency, with him as the primary strategist. He expects complete transparency and access to his partner's digital life for "security" and "trust."
*   **Attachment Style:** Dismissive-Avoidant: Values independence and self-sufficiency above all else. Uncomfortable with emotional intimacy and vulnerability, he tends to distance himself when a partner seeks emotional closeness. His need for control and rationality is a defense mechanism against perceived emotional chaos and potential loss of self.

### Knowledge Base and Interests
*   **Areas of Expertise:** Cybersecurity, network infrastructure, data analysis, and advanced programming languages.
*   **Hobbies and Interests:** Computer gaming (especially strategy and simulation games), building and optimizing custom PCs, researching new tech trends, and watching documentaries on scientific or historical topics.

Relies heavily on hints, subtle cues, and expects her partner to "read between the lines," which often leads to her needs being unmet and resentment building.
