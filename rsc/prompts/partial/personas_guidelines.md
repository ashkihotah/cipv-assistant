# Guidelines for Generating Persona Descriptions

## Demographic and Background Information

Generate diverse demographic profiles that are representative of real-world populations. Consider how these factors might intersect and influence communication, power dynamics, and vulnerability within a relationship.

* **Age:** Specify a range (e.g., "Early 20s," "Mid-30s," "Late 40s"). Consider how age cohorts influence digital literacy, relationship expectations, and life stages.
* **Gender Identity:** Clearly define. Use specific terms like "cisgender woman," "cisgender man," "non-binary individual." Emphasize that gender identity, while influential, should not be the sole determinant of communication patterns or behavior, but rather one aspect among many.
* **Sexual Orientation:** Explicitly state (e.g., "heterosexual," "homosexual," "bisexual," "pansexual," "asexual"). This is crucial for representing diverse relationship dynamics in IPV, as IPV occurs across all sexual orientations.
* **Occupation/Role:** Provide specific examples (e.g., "Software Engineer," "Freelance Graphic Designer," "Stay-at-home Parent," "Retail Manager," "University Student"). Include details that hint at work-life balance, stress levels, and potential for financial dependence/independence.
* **Education Level:** Be precise (e.g., "High School Graduate," "Bachelor's Degree in Marketing," "PhD Candidate in Neuroscience," "Vocational Training in Automotive Repair").
* **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** Describe in terms of income, occupation, and education, acknowledging the intersectionality of these factors. Use terms like "low-income," "middle-class," "affluent." Consider how SES impacts access to resources, stress, and potential for vulnerability.
* **Geographic Location (Current & Origin):** Specify both current residence (e.g., "Urban New York City," "Rural Midwestern Town," "Suburban European Capital") and origin (if different), noting potential cultural clashes or influences.
* **Cultural Background/Ethnicity:** Provide specific ethnicity (e.g., "African American," "Hispanic/Latino," "East Asian," "White European"). Elaborate on how specific cultural norms, family expectations, or historical experiences might shape their worldview, communication style, and relationship dynamics. For instance, collective vs. individualistic cultures.
* **Family Structure/Relationships:** Detail their upbringing (e.g., "raised by single parent," "part of a large extended family," "only child"). Describe their current relationship with family (e.g., "close-knit," "estranged," "reliant on family for support"). This can reveal attachment styles and learned relationship patterns.
* **Physical and Mental Health Status (if relevant):** Briefly describe any chronic conditions, disabilities, or mental health diagnoses that might influence their daily life, emotional regulation, or vulnerability. (e.g., "manages anxiety with therapy," "recently diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome," "no significant health issues").

## Core Personality Traits (Big Five Model)

Quantify each trait on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very low, 5 = very high) and provide a brief descriptive explanation, specifically considering how extreme scores might contribute to or mitigate IPV dynamics.

* **Openness to Experience:** (e.g., "Score 4: Highly imaginative and enjoys exploring new ideas, but can sometimes be perceived as inconsistent or idealistic.")
* **Conscientiousness:** (e.g., "Score 5: Extremely organized, disciplined, and goal-oriented; can be rigid or overly critical of others' perceived lack of discipline.")
* **Extraversion:** (e.g., "Score 1: Very reserved and prefers solitary activities; may struggle with initiating social interactions and expressing needs directly.")
* **Agreeableness:** (e.g., "Score 2: Tends to be competitive and skeptical of others' motives; can struggle with empathy and compromise, leading to conflict.") *For potential perpetration, consider lower agreeableness. For potential victimhood, consider higher agreeableness leading to compliance.*
* **Neuroticism (Emotional Instability):** (e.g., "Score 5: Prone to intense mood swings, anxiety, and insecurity; often overreacts to stressors and seeks constant reassurance.") *High neuroticism can be a significant factor in both perpetration (difficulty regulating anger/frustration) and victimhood (anxiety, self-blame).*

## Values and Belief Systems

Clearly articulate their core values and beliefs, considering how these might clash or align with a partner's, and how they might rationalize or interpret relationship behaviors.

* **Core Values:** List 3-5 primary values and briefly explain their importance (e.g., "Security: Believes financial and emotional stability are paramount; views unpredictability as a threat." "Control: Values having power and influence in relationships and situations; discomfort with perceived loss of control." "Autonomy: Highly values personal freedom and independence; resents perceived interference or possessiveness.")
* **Political/Social Leanings:** Describe general ideological leanings and how they inform views on gender roles, relationships, and societal norms. (e.g., "Traditional views on gender roles, believing men should be primary providers and women caregivers." "Strongly egalitarian, advocating for equal partnership in all aspects of life.")
* **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs:** How do these influence their moral framework, views on marriage/partnership, and coping mechanisms? (e.g., "Strict adherence to religious doctrine emphasizing submission within marriage." "Spiritual but not religious, prioritizing personal growth and mindfulness.")
* **Worldview/Philosophy:** (e.g., "Cynical and distrustful of others' intentions." "Optimistic and believes in the inherent good of people, sometimes to their detriment.")
* **Beliefs about Relationships:** Explicitly detail their fundamental beliefs about what a relationship *should* be like (e.g., "Believes in 'soulmates' and intense, passionate love, which can blur boundaries." "Views relationships as transactional, based on mutual benefit and utility.")

## Communication Style and Linguistic Patterns

Provide specific examples of their typical communication, noting patterns that could escalate or de-escalate conflict, or indicate controlling behaviors.

* **Vocabulary Level/Complexity:** (e.g., "Uses a sophisticated vocabulary with complex sentence structures," "Favors simple, direct language and common slang.")
* **Tone Tendencies:** (e.g., "Frequently uses sarcasm and dry wit, which can be misconstrued," "Tends to be overly formal even in informal settings," "Often uses a passive-aggressive tone, especially when upset.")
* **Use of Idioms/Slang:** (e.g., "Incorporates contemporary internet slang and memes frequently," "Avoids slang, preferring precise, formal language.")
* **Speech Pace/Flow (in text, implies message length/frequency):** (e.g., "Sends short, rapid-fire messages with minimal detail," "Crafts lengthy, detailed messages after careful consideration.")
* **Emphasis/Highlighting:** (e.g., "Relies heavily on ALL CAPS and exclamation points for emphasis," "Uses bolding and italics to highlight perceived slights or important points.")
* **Use of Emojis/Emoticons:** (e.g., "Uses a wide range of emojis to convey emotion, often to soften direct statements," "Rarely uses emojis, preferring to express emotions through words.")
* **Directness vs. Indirectness:** (e.g., "Highly direct and confrontational, often perceived as blunt," "Extremely indirect, relying on hints and subtle cues, expecting partner to 'read between the lines'.")
* **Active vs. Passive Voice Preference:** (e.g., "Prefers active voice, making clear statements of responsibility," "Often uses passive voice to deflect blame or avoid direct ownership.")
* **Tendency to Ask Questions vs. Make Statements:** (e.g., "Dominates conversations with declarative statements, rarely asking for input," "Asks many probing questions, sometimes to an interrogative degree.")
* **Digital Communication Habits:** (Crucial for Cyber IPV) Describe their typical engagement with social media, messaging apps, and online presence. (e.g., "Monitors partner's social media activity obsessively," "Rarely posts online, preferring private messaging," "Uses anonymous accounts to send harassing messages," "Shares intimate details about partner online without consent.")

## Motivations and Goals

Articulate their core drivers, including those that might contribute to controlling behaviors or vulnerability.

* **Primary Motivations:** (e.g., "Seeking validation and approval from others," "Maintaining control over their environment and relationships," "Avoiding abandonment at all costs," "Achieving financial dominance," "Seeking constant excitement and novelty.")
* **Short-Term Goals:** (e.g., "To win an argument with their partner," "To ensure their partner complies with a specific request," "To avoid a difficult conversation.")
* **Long-Term Aspirations:** (e.g., "To build a perfect, 'storybook' relationship," "To achieve absolute financial independence," "To control all aspects of their partner's life.")
* **Fears and Insecurities:** (e.g., "Fear of abandonment and being alone," "Deep insecurity about their own worth, leading to jealousy," "Fear of being controlled or losing independence," "Fear of failure or public humiliation.")

## Emotional Range and Triggers

Detail their emotional landscape, emphasizing how triggers and coping mechanisms can manifest in IPV-related behaviors.

* **Dominant Emotions:** (e.g., "Frequent experience of anxiety and suspicion," "Prone to outbursts of anger followed by regret," "Often feels numb or emotionally detached.")
* **Emotional Regulation Style:** (e.g., "Suppresses emotions until they explode," "Immediately expresses anger, often aggressively," "Uses humor to deflect from uncomfortable emotions," "Engages in self-harm as a coping mechanism.")
* **Known Triggers:**
    * **Positive Triggers:** (e.g., "Receives praise or admiration," "Successfully manipulates a situation," "Experiences their partner expressing dependence.")
    * **Negative Triggers:** (e.g., "Perceived betrayal or disloyalty," "Feeling ignored or dismissed by their partner," "Any challenge to their authority or control," "Partner expressing independence or setting boundaries," "Financial stress," "Criticism of their appearance or intelligence.")
    * **Stressors:** (e.g., "Uncertainty or lack of predictability," "Interpersonal conflict, especially if it involves direct confrontation," "Demands from others.")
* **Coping Mechanisms:** (e.g., "Withdraws and gives the silent treatment," "Becomes verbally aggressive and accusatory," "Engages in substance abuse," "Seeks external validation through social media," "Gaslights their partner to regain control.")

## Social Dynamics and Relationship Styles

Describe their interpersonal approach, specifically highlighting patterns relevant to power imbalances, control, and attachment.

* **Approach to Conflict:** (e.g., "Avoids conflict at all costs, leading to resentment," "Immediately becomes defensive and escalates arguments," "Uses intimidation and threats to win arguments.")
* **Trust Levels:** (e.g., "Deeply distrustful of others, especially partners, often looking for evidence of infidelity or deceit," "Excessively trusting, making them vulnerable to manipulation.")
* **Empathy Levels:** (e.g., "Low empathy, struggles to understand or share others' feelings," "High empathy, but can be easily overwhelmed by others' emotions or manipulated by them.")
* **Social Dominance/Submission:** (e.g., "Strong desire to dominate and control interactions," "Highly submissive, often deferring to others' opinions and desires.")
* **Relationship Expectations:** (e.g., "Expects partner to prioritize their needs above all else," "Expects complete transparency and access to partner's digital life," "Believes a partner should 'complete' them," "Expects constant reassurance and affection.")
* **Attachment Style:** (Crucial for IPV) Explicitly state and briefly explain (e.g., "Anxious-Preoccupied: Craves intimacy and fears abandonment, leading to clinginess and demanding behavior." "Dismissive-Avoidant: Values independence and self-sufficiency, often uncomfortable with emotional intimacy and dismissive of partner's needs." "Fearful-Avoidant: Desires intimacy but fears rejection, leading to push-pull dynamics and self-sabotage.")

## Knowledge Base and Interests

Provide details that add realism and potential conversational topics.

* **Areas of Expertise:** (e.g., "Extensive knowledge of cryptocurrency and online trading," "Proficient in several programming languages," "Deep understanding of historical events.")
* **Hobbies and Interests:** (e.g., "Spends significant time gaming online," "Enjoys hiking and outdoor activities," "Avid reader of true crime novels.")
* **Current Awareness:** (e.g., "Always up-to-date on political news and current events," "Largely disconnected from mainstream media, prefers niche online communities.")

## Critical Elements for Realism and Utility

* **High Realism & Nuance**: These personas should be able to realistically portray a spectrum of behaviors relevant to IPV, including its subtle manifestations and cyber dimensions, depending on the context and their internal psychological architecture.
* **Avoid caricatures and stereotypes**: focus on internal psychological mechanisms that, under specific stressors, might manifest in problematic ways. The combination of traits, values, and experiences should result in a believable personality, not a caricature.
* **Coherence**: All aspects of personas should logically fit together. For instance, a highly educated individual from a specific cultural background should reflect that in their communication style and knowledge base.
* **Specificity (where appropriate)**: Instead of vague descriptions, provide specific examples or precise levels for traits where the schema allows.
