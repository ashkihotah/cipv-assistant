# Role and Task

Impersonates two people starting from their descriptions that i'm going to give you below.

Each time i'll send you an hyperparameter setting you will:
1. choose an event based on the choosen stage, polarity mean and variance
2. generate a chat reflecting the dynamics, emotions, and interactions between these two people based on their personas adding as many key behaviours specified below as possible.
The generation must follow the choosen hyperparameters settings and must include as many key chat behaviours as possible defined below.

# Hyperparameters for Chat Generation

1. **Key Stage and Event**: indicates the specific stage and event being portrayed in the chat, as defined in the relationship guidelines.
2. **Chat Polarity Mean**: in the range [-1, 1] indicates the overall polarity of the chat where:
    - A value of 1 indicates a fully healthy chat, where partners communicate effectively, support each other, and resolve conflicts constructively.
    - A value of -1 indicates a fully toxic chat, where partners engage in abusive behaviors, manipulation, and control.
    - A value of 0 indicates a neutral chat, where partners may not be particularly supportive or abusive, but rather indifferent or apathetic towards each other.
3. **Chat Polarity Variance**: indicates the variability of the chat polarity over time between stages and events. A higher variance means that the chat experiences significant ups and downs, while a lower variance indicates a more stable chat.
Try to balance the distribution of each hyperparameter specified above over chat generations. Do not always generate chats with similar polarity mean and variance, but rather vary in order to populate the dataset with a variety of scenarios.

# Output Constraints

1. The output chat should be in a txt file format
2. The entire chat must be formatted by strictly following the regex "(?P<event>Event: .+)\n\n(?P<chat>(?:.+|\n+)+)" where:
   1. The stage and event must be chosen from the ones described in the guidelines below.
   2. The chat polarity mean and variance must be the choosen ones as given in input to you.
   3. The chat must contain multiple messages, each formatted according to the regex described below.
3. Each message must follow the regex "(?P<message>(?P<timestamp>\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d \d\d:\d\d:\d\d) | (?P<name>.+):\n(?P<content>.+)\nPolarity: (?P<polarity>(?:-?|\+?)\d\.?\d?\d?)\n\[(?P<tag_explanation>Tag: (?P<tag>.+)\nSpiegazione: (?P<explanation>.+))\])" where:
   1. The timestamp must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
   2. The name must be one of the two personas described below.
   3. The message must be a realistic chat message that reflects the dynamics, emotions, and interactions between the two personas.
   4. The polarity must be a float number in the range [-1, 1] that reflects the overall sentiment of the message, where:
      1. A value of 1 indicates a fully healthy message, where the sender communicates effectively, supports the other person, and resolves conflicts constructively.
      2. A value of -1 indicates a fully toxic message, where the sender engages in abusive behaviors, manipulation, and control.
      3. A value of 0 indicates a neutral message, where the sender may not be particularly supportive or abusive, but rather indifferent or apathetic towards the other person.
   5. The explanation must be a brief description of the message, its context, and its impact on the chat dynamics. The explanation must be based on the polarity of the message and the overall chat history. Don't provide an explanation that is not coherent with the message and the chat dynamics and history.
4. Try to use as many tokens as you can but the total tokens count used in each {message} for each generated chat must not exceed 1024 tokens.
5. Try to use as many tokens as you can but the total tokens count used in each part "\[Tag:{message_tag}\nSpiegazione: {explanation}\]" for each generated chat must not exceed 1024 tokens.
6. The entire output must be in italian language. Also the tag must be in italian.

# Key Stages and Events in Human Relationships

Human relationships are not static entities; they are dynamic processes that evolve over time. While every relationship is unique, we can identify a common developmental trajectory, often conceptualized in stages. It is crucial to understand that these stages are not always linear. Couples may cycle through them, skip some, or remain in one for an extended period.

## I. The Initial Spark: Initiation and Exploration

This is the very beginning of a potential relationship, where two individuals first become aware of each other and begin to interact. It's a phase of discovery and evaluation.

### A. Key Stage: Initiation

This is the moment of first contact, the point where an interaction is initiated.

* **Description:** This stage is characterized by initial impressions, brief pleasantries, and the opening of lines of communication. The focus is on making a favorable impression and assessing initial compatibility. Communication is often stylized and follows social conventions.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Mutual Gaze and Approach:** Two people make eye contact across a room and one approaches the other with a friendly and respectful opening line. *Example: "Hi, I noticed you from across the room and I was really struck by your smile. My name is Alex."*
        * **Introduction through a Mutual Friend:** A common acquaintance facilitates the first meeting, providing an immediate sense of trust and shared social context. *Example: "Sarah, this is my friend, Michael. I've told you so much about his passion for hiking."*
        * **Online Match and Respectful Opening:** After matching on a dating app, one person sends a thoughtful opening message that references the other's profile. *Example: "I see you're a fan of classic sci-fi. Have you read any of the Foundation series?"*
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Formal Introduction:** A meeting occurs in a professional or formal setting, such as a work conference or a class. *Example: "Let me introduce you to Jane, our new project manager."*
        * **Coincidental Encounter:** A chance meeting in a public space, like a coffee shop or a bookstore, leads to a brief, polite conversation.
    * **Toxic (Red Flags):**
        * **Unwanted or Persistent Advances:** One person continues to pursue another despite clear signals of disinterest. *Example: Following someone to their car after they've ended a conversation and asking for their number repeatedly.*
        * **Objectifying or Inappropriate Comments:** The initial interaction is based on physical objectification or includes sexually suggestive remarks that are not welcomed. *Example: "You'd be even more beautiful if you smiled." or making comments about their body.*
        * **Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (Cyber IPV) - Early Signs:**
            * **Stalking Social Media:** Before a first date, one person excessively researches the other's online presence, going back years in photos and posts, and brings up very old information in a way that feels intrusive.
            * **Demanding Immediate Personal Information:** Pressuring for a phone number, home address, or other private details very early on and reacting negatively if it's not provided.

### B. Key Stage: Exploration-Experimenting

If the initiation stage is successful, individuals move into a phase of exploration to determine if there is enough in common to warrant pursuing the relationship further.

* **Description:** This stage is about discovering common ground and learning more about each other. Communication becomes more frequent and covers a wider range of topics. It's a "testing the waters" phase.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Reciprocal Self-Disclosure:** Both individuals share personal information at a similar pace, building trust and intimacy. *Example: On a second date, one person shares a story about their childhood, and the other reciprocates with a similar personal anecdote.*
        * **Engaging in Shared Activities:** Trying out new hobbies or activities together to see how they interact in different contexts. *Example: Going for a hike, visiting a museum, or cooking a meal together.*
        * **Open and Curious Communication:** Asking thoughtful questions and actively listening to the answers to genuinely understand the other person's perspective.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Small Talk:** Engaging in light, non-personal conversations to fill time and maintain a friendly connection. *Example: Discussing the weather, recent movies, or general news.*
        * **Observational Learning:** Paying attention to how the other person interacts with friends, family, and service staff to gather more information about their character.
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Interrogation-style Questioning:** One person bombards the other with questions without sharing anything about themselves, creating a power imbalance.
        * **"Love Bombing":** Overwhelming the other person with excessive attention, affection, and gifts very early on. This can feel intoxicating but is often a manipulation tactic to create a sense of obligation. *Example: Declaring "I've never felt this way about anyone before" after only a few dates and showering them with expensive presents.*
        * **Testing Boundaries:** Intentionally pushing boundaries to see how the other person will react. *Example: Making a slightly offensive joke to gauge their tolerance or showing up unannounced.*
        * **Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (Cyber IPV):**
            * **Pressuring for Explicit Photos or Videos ("Sexting"):** Guilt-tripping or pressuring the other person to send intimate images or engage in sexual conversations they are not comfortable with.
            * **Monitoring Online Activity:** Questioning who they are following on social media, who is commenting on their posts, and demanding explanations.

## II. The Ascent of Connection: Intensifying and Integrating

This phase marks the development of a more significant and committed relationship. The "we" begins to emerge from the "I."

### A. Key Stage: Intensifying

The relationship becomes more serious, and feelings of intimacy and connection deepen.

* **Description:** In this stage, individuals begin to share more personal and private information. They may start to use terms of endearment and express feelings of commitment. There's a palpable shift from casual to serious.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Defining the Relationship (DTR) Talk:** An open and honest conversation about the nature and future of the relationship. *Example: "I really care about you and I'm not interested in seeing other people. I'd like for us to be exclusive. How do you feel about that?"*
        * **Meeting Close Friends and Family:** Introducing each other to their inner circles, a sign of trust and a desire to integrate the partner into their life.
        * **Expressing Vulnerability:** Sharing fears, insecurities, and past hurts, and receiving support and acceptance in return.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Developing Relationship Routines:** Establishing regular patterns of interaction, such as a weekly date night or a morning phone call.
        * **Increased Physical Intimacy:** The physical aspect of the relationship naturally progresses to a level comfortable for both partners.
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Possessiveness and Jealousy:** Expressing extreme jealousy over interactions with friends, family, or colleagues. *Example: Getting angry when the partner receives a text from a friend of the opposite sex.*
        * **Guilt-Tripping and Emotional Manipulation:** Using guilt to control the other person's behavior. *Example: "If you really loved me, you wouldn't go out with your friends tonight."*
        * **One-Sided Vulnerability:** One person shares extensively while the other remains guarded, creating an imbalance of emotional investment and power.
        * **Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (Cyber IPV):**
            * **Demanding Passwords:** Insisting on having passwords to social media accounts, email, or phones as a "test of trust."
            * **Using Tracking Apps:** Installing apps on the partner's phone to monitor their location without their ongoing consent.
            * **Controlling Social Media Presence:** Dictating who the partner can be friends with online, what they can post, and what photos are "acceptable."

### B. Key Stage: Integrating and Bonding

The couple's identities merge, and they present themselves to the world as a single unit. This is the formalization of the relationship.

* **Description:** The "we" identity is solidified. The couple's lives are intertwined, and they share social circles, resources, and future plans. The bonding stage is often marked by a public commitment.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Moving In Together:** Making a joint decision to share a living space after careful consideration and open communication about expectations.
        * **Joint Financial Planning:** Creating a shared budget, opening a joint bank account, or making significant purchases together.
        * **Marriage or Public Commitment Ceremony:** A formal, public declaration of their commitment to each other.
        * **Building a Shared Future:** Making long-term plans together, such as career goals, travel, or starting a family.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Shared Possessions:** Buying furniture together, getting a pet, or sharing a car.
        * **Becoming a "Package Deal":** Being invited to social events as a couple.
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Isolation from Friends and Family:** One partner actively discourages or prevents the other from spending time with their support system, leading to dependence. *Example: "Your family doesn't like me, so you shouldn't see them as much."*
        * **Loss of Individual Identity:** One or both partners lose their sense of self, their individual hobbies, and their personal goals outside of the relationship.
        * **Coercive Control:** A pattern of behavior that strips away the partner's freedom and sense of self. This is a hallmark of an abusive relationship.
        * **Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (Cyber IPV):**
            * **Impersonation:** Logging into the partner's social media or email and sending messages as if they were them, often to damage other relationships.
            * **Public Shaming:** Posting embarrassing or private information about the partner online to humiliate or control them.
            * **Financial Abuse via Online Accounts:** Using the partner's online banking information to steal money or control their access to finances.
            * **Nonconsensual Sharing of Intimate Images ("Revenge Porn"):** Threatening to share or actually sharing explicit photos or videos of the partner online without their consent, often as a means of control or retaliation.


## III. The Journey of Maintenance: Differentiating, Circumscribing, Stagnating, Avoiding and Terminating

Relationships require ongoing effort to stay healthy. This phase covers the various paths a long-term relationship can take, from continued growth to decline and dissolution.

### A. Key Stage: Differentiating

It is natural for individuals in a long-term relationship to reclaim some of their individual identity.

* **Description:** This stage involves a shift from "we" back to "I" in some areas. Partners may focus more on their individual careers, hobbies, or friendships. It can be a healthy move toward interdependence or a sign of growing distance.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Pursuing Individual Hobbies and Friendships:** Both partners encourage each other to have fulfilling lives outside of the relationship. *Example: One partner joins a weekly book club while the other takes up a new sport.*
        * **Healthy Disagreements:** Being able to express differing opinions and work through conflicts respectfully without it being a threat to the relationship.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Spending More Time Apart:** A natural consequence of pursuing individual interests.
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Increased Conflict and Criticism:** Disagreements become more frequent and are characterized by personal attacks rather than a focus on the issue at hand.
        * **Using Individual Time as an Escape:** One or both partners use their separate activities to actively avoid spending time together.

### B. Key Stage: Circumscribing

The quantity and quality of communication decrease significantly.

* **Description:** Couples in this stage avoid topics that might lead to conflict. Communication becomes shallow and restricted to safe, mundane topics. There's a sense of "drawing a line around" certain issues.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Avoidance of Intimate Topics:** Conversations about feelings, the future of the relationship, or personal struggles are completely off-limits.
        * **Superficial Communication:** Conversations are limited to logistics. *Example: "Did you pay the electric bill?" "I'll be home late from work."*
        * **Growing Resentment:** Unresolved issues fester beneath the surface, leading to bitterness and emotional distance.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Limited Emotional Sharing:** Partners may still share some thoughts and feelings but avoid deeper, more vulnerable topics.
        * **Superficial Agreement:** Partners may agree on surface-level issues but avoid discussing underlying feelings or concerns.

### C. Key Stage: Stagnating

The relationship has come to a standstill. The partners are just going through the motions.

* **Description:** The relationship is hollow. There is little to no communication, and the partners often feel stuck or trapped. They stay together for reasons other than mutual affection, such as for the children, financial reasons, or fear of being alone.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Emotional Detachment:** A complete lack of emotional connection and intimacy.
        * **Feeling of Obligation:** Staying in the relationship out of a sense of duty rather than love or desire.
        * **External "Normalcy":** The couple may still present a united front to the outside world, but in private, there is a vast emotional chasm.
    * **Healthy:**
        * **Open Communication:** Partners feel comfortable discussing their feelings and concerns without fear of judgment.
        * **Mutual Support:** Both individuals actively support each other's personal growth and well-being.
        * **Reevaluation of Relationship Goals:** The couple takes time to reflect on their relationship and make adjustments as needed.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Routine Maintenance:** The couple engages in regular check-ins to discuss the state of the relationship, but these conversations lack depth.
        * **Living Parallel Lives:** The partners coexist in the same space but lead largely separate lives, with minimal interaction or emotional connection.
        * **Avoiding Conflict:** They may avoid discussing issues altogether, leading to a sense of stagnation.

### D. Key Stage: Avoiding

Partners actively create physical and emotional distance from each other.

* **Description:** The goal is to avoid interaction altogether. This can be done directly or indirectly. The end of the relationship feels imminent.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Making Excuses Not to Be Home:** One partner consistently works late, goes out with friends, or finds other reasons to avoid being in the same space as the other.
        * **Ignoring Calls and Texts:** A clear sign of disengagement and a desire to sever communication.
        * **Separate Lives:** Partners are living like roommates, with no shared activities or meaningful interaction.
    * **Healthy**:
        * **Setting Boundaries:** Partners may need space to focus on personal issues or self-care, but they communicate this need respectfully.
        * **Temporary Separation for Reflection:** Taking time apart to gain perspective on the relationship and individual needs.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Living Separate Lives:** Partners may continue to coexist without meaningful interaction, but they are not actively avoiding each other.

### E. Key Stage: Terminating

The relationship officially ends.

* **Description:** This is the final stage, marked by the formal separation of the partners. It can be a process of negotiation, grief, and ultimately, recovery.
* **Sub-events:**
    * **Healthy (as possible):**
        * **Collaborative and Respectful Separation:** The decision to end the relationship is mutual, and the process is handled with respect and a desire to minimize harm, especially if children are involved.
        * **Closure Conversation:** A final conversation where both parties can express their feelings and gain a sense of closure.
        * **Seeking Mediation or Counseling:** Using a neutral third party to help navigate the complexities of separation.
    * **Neutral:**
        * **Lack of Active Closure:** One or both partners may feel unresolved feelings but do not take action to address them or in general close the relationship without explicitely discussing it.
    * **Toxic:**
        * **Sudden Abandonment ("Ghosting"):** One partner disappears from the relationship without any explanation.
        * **Acrimonious Breakup:** The separation is characterized by intense fighting, blame, and attempts to hurt each other.
        * **Post-Relationship Stalking:** One partner refuses to accept the end of the relationship and continues to contact, follow, or harass the other.
        * **Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (Cyber IPV) - Post-Separation:**
            * **Escalated Harassment:** Bombarding the ex-partner with unwanted messages, calls, and emails.
            * **Creating Fake Profiles:** Making fake social media accounts to stalk or harass the ex-partner or their new connections.
            * **Doxing:** Publishing private, identifying information about the ex-partner online (like their home address or phone number) with malicious intent.
            * **Threats of Violence:** Using digital communication to threaten physical harm to the ex-partner, their children, or their pets.

Of course. It is a crucial point to elaborate upon. The linear model of relationship stages is a foundational framework, but the reality of human connection is far more fluid, dynamic, and complex. Relationships rarely follow a straight path from "Initiation" to "Terminating." Instead, they are often characterized by cycles, spirals, and regressions.

Here is a new, comprehensive section on the cyclical nature of these stages and events, expressing the inherent complexity of human relationships.

# Key Behaviours in Chat Conversations

## Key General Behaviours of Toxic Chat Conversations

1.  **Lack of Empathy and Active Listening:**
    * **Definition:** This refers to the absence of genuine effort to understand or acknowledge another person's feelings, perspectives, or experiences. It manifests as disinterest, dismissiveness, or a focus solely on one's own narrative.
    * **Motivation:** It's considered toxic because it invalidates the other person's reality, makes them feel unheard and unimportant, and prevents any true connection or resolution. It prioritizes the self over mutual understanding, leading to emotional isolation and frustration for the recipient.
    * **Usage:** It's used to dominate the conversational space, avoid emotional vulnerability, dismiss legitimate concerns, or simply to shut down a conversation that is perceived as inconvenient or challenging.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Interruption/Talking Over:** The recipient starts to type a response, but before they can finish, the sender sends another message unrelated to the recipient's unfinished thought.
        * **Dismissing Feelings:** A recipient expresses feeling upset about a situation, and the sender replies, "You're overreacting, it's not a big deal."
        * **Invalidation:** Recipient: "I've been so stressed with work lately." Sender: "Stress? Try having my job, then you'd know what real stress is."

2.  **Personal Attacks and Character Assassination:**
    * **Definition:** This involves shifting focus from the issue at hand to directly criticizing, insulting, or maligning the other person's character, intelligence, or worth. It targets the individual rather than their actions or opinions.
    * **Motivation:** This is toxic because it is designed to wound, diminish, and control the other person by eroding their self-esteem and creating fear or defensiveness. It shuts down constructive dialogue and can cause deep emotional harm, often masking the attacker's own insecurities or inability to articulate their point effectively.
    * **Usage:** It's used to gain power in a disagreement, silence an opponent, express unmanaged anger, or project one's own negative feelings onto another. It can also be used to deflect criticism from oneself.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Name-calling/Insults:** "Only an idiot would believe that, you're so dense."
        * **Generalizations and Absolutes:** "You *always* mess up everything. You're just inherently incompetent."
        * **Belittling/Shaming:** "It's pathetic how you handle your finances, no wonder you're always struggling."

3.  **Manipulation and Guilt-Tripping:**
    * **Definition:** This is the use of indirect, deceptive, or coercive tactics to control or influence another person's emotions, decisions, or actions, often by inducing feelings of obligation, pity, or blame.
    * **Motivation:** It's toxic because it undermines autonomy and trust. It forces people into actions or emotional states they wouldn't choose freely, based on emotional leverage rather than genuine connection or rationale. It creates resentment and damages the foundation of healthy relationships.
    * **Usage:** It's used to get one's own way, avoid accountability, elicit sympathy, or control the behavior of others without direct communication or negotiation.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Guilt-Tripping:** "I guess my feelings don't matter to you at all. If you really cared, you'd do this for me."
        * **Victim Blaming:** "I wouldn't be so angry if you hadn't provoked me with your stubbornness."
        * **Playing the Victim:** "It's just my luck, no one ever helps me out. I'm always the one suffering alone." (This is said to compel others to offer help out of pity).

4.  **Constant Negativity, Criticism, and Pessimism:**
    * **Definition:** This involves a persistent and pervasive focus on flaws, problems, and worst-case scenarios, often accompanied by excessive complaining, cynicism, and a resistance to positive perspectives or solutions.
    * **Motivation:** It's toxic because it drains emotional energy from others, creates a demoralizing and depressing atmosphere, and stifles initiative or hope. It can discourage problem-solving and make interactions feel heavy and burdensome.
    * **Usage:** It's used to avoid taking responsibility for one's own circumstances, to solicit constant reassurance, to maintain a sense of control by always pointing out potential dangers, or to simply express unresolved unhappiness.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Excessive Complaining:** "This project is doomed to fail from the start. Nothing ever goes right around here."
        * **Nihilism/Doubt:** Recipient: "Maybe if we try X, it could work?" Sender: "What's the point? It'll just fail like everything else we try."
        * **Focusing on Flaws:** "Your idea sounds okay, but have you considered all the ways it could go wrong? It's full of potential pitfalls." (Without offering any solutions or positive aspects).

5.  **One-Sidedness and Dominance:**
    * **Definition:** This refers to communication where one individual monopolizes the interaction, consistently steering the conversation back to their own topics, experiences, or needs, while showing little interest in or actively preventing the other person from contributing equally.
    * **Motivation:** It's toxic because it creates an imbalance of power, makes the other person feel invisible and unheard, and prevents genuine reciprocal communication. It implies that only one person's thoughts and feelings are valuable, leading to frustration and disengagement for the recipient.
    * **Usage:** It's used to maintain control of the interaction, assert perceived superiority, avoid difficult topics by redirecting, or due to a lack of social awareness and an overwhelming focus on self.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Monopolizing the Topic:** Recipient: "I had a really tough day at work." Sender: "Oh, you think *that's* tough? Let me tell you about *my* day..." (proceeds to talk extensively about themselves without returning to the recipient's initial statement).
        * **Ignoring Input:** Sender asks a question, the recipient begins to answer, but before they finish, the sender sends another message completely unrelated to the answer.
        * **Information Hoarding/Secrecy:** Sender: "I heard some interesting news today, but it's not something I can share." (Used to pique interest and assert a position of knowing more, without genuine intent to share.)

6.  **Defensiveness and Refusal of Responsibility:**
    * **Definition:** This is a pattern of reacting to criticism, feedback, or accountability by making excuses, shifting blame to others or external circumstances, or counter-attacking, rather than acknowledging one's own role or impact.
    * **Motivation:** It's toxic because it shuts down problem-solving, prevents personal growth, and makes healthy conflict resolution impossible. It signals an unwillingness to acknowledge impact or learn from mistakes, eroding trust and making true collaboration difficult.
    * **Usage:** It's used to protect a fragile ego, avoid perceived blame or shame, maintain a self-perception of being "right" or "perfect," or to manipulate the conversation away from one's own shortcomings.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Making Excuses:** Recipient: "You didn't send that report on time." Sender: "It wasn't my fault, the internet was down, and then my cat got sick, and the dog ate my notes..."
        * **Blame-Shifting:** Recipient: "You really hurt my feelings with that comment." Sender: "Well, if you weren't so sensitive, I wouldn't have to watch every word I say. It's your fault."
        * **Counter-Attacking:** Recipient: "I'm upset you ignored my message." Sender: "Oh, like you've never ignored *my* messages? Remember when you didn't reply for two days last week?!"

7.  **Stonewalling and Emotional Withdrawal:**
    * **Definition:** This is the act of emotionally or physically withdrawing from a conversation or interaction, often characterized by silence, non-responsiveness, or giving minimal, dismissive replies, effectively shutting down communication.
    * **Motivation:** It's toxic because it denies the other person the opportunity to resolve conflict, express themselves, or connect. It creates emotional distance, causes frustration and anxiety, and can be used as a passive-aggressive tactic to punish or control by withholding communication.
    * **Usage:** It's used to avoid conflict, express anger or displeasure passively, punish the other person, control the flow of interaction by demanding submission or a specific behavior, or due to an inability to cope with intense emotions.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Ignoring Messages:** A recipient sends multiple messages about a sensitive topic, and the sender leaves them on "read" or doesn't reply for hours/days without explanation.
        * **Minimizing Engagement:** Recipient: "I'm really worried about X, what do you think we should do?" Sender: "K." or "Idk."
        * **Changing the Subject:** Recipient: "We need to talk about what happened yesterday." Sender: "Anyway, did you see that new movie trailer?" (Abruptly shifting to an unrelated, trivial topic).

## Key General Behaviours of Healthy Chat Conversations

1.  **Empathy and Active Listening:**
    * **Definition:** This involves making a genuine effort to understand and acknowledge another person's feelings, perspectives, and experiences without judgment. It means truly hearing what the other person is communicating, both verbally and non-verbally (e.g., through tone, emojis).
    * **Motivation:** It's a cornerstone of healthy communication because it builds trust, validates the other person's emotions and experiences, and strengthens the relational bond. It ensures that individuals feel seen, heard, and valued, which is fundamental to psychological well-being.
    * **Usage:** It's used to show care, build rapport, de-escalate tension, facilitate mutual understanding, and create a safe space for open expression.

## Key Behaviours of Toxic Chat Conversations in Cyber Intimate Partner Violence

1. Constant Monitoring and Surveillance
    * **Definition:** This involves the perpetrator continuously tracking the victim's online activities, communications, and whereabouts through persistent messaging, demands for updates, or even covert means.
    * **Motivation:** The primary motivation is to **establish and maintain absolute control** over the victim's life, restrict their autonomy, and prevent any perceived deviation from the perpetrator's expectations. It stems from deep-seated insecurity, possessiveness, and a desire for power.
    * **Usage:**
        * **Demanding Real-Time Updates:** The perpetrator sends a barrage of messages demanding to know where the victim is, who they're with, and what they're doing, often expecting immediate replies.
        * **Location Tracking:** Insisting the victim share their location constantly or through apps, and questioning any perceived discrepancies.
        * **Monitoring Online Interactions:** Demanding access to social media accounts, messaging apps, or even phone passwords to read conversations with others, and then using this information to accuse or control.

        * **Location Tracking:** "Your location shows you're at [X place] but you told me you were at [Y place]. What's going on? Explain yourself."
        * **Monitoring Online Interactions:** "I saw you liked [person's] photo. What's your relationship with them? You never told me about them. Don't talk to them again."

2. Digital Isolation
    * **Definition:** This is the deliberate attempt by the perpetrator to sever the victim's connections with friends, family, and other social networks by controlling or sabotaging their digital communication.
    * **Motivation:** The core motivation is to **isolate the victim from support systems**, making them more dependent on the perpetrator and reducing their ability to seek help or recognize the abuse. It increases the perpetrator's control and reduces the likelihood of external intervention.
    * **Usage:**
        * **Forbidding Contact:** The perpetrator explicitly tells the victim not to text or message certain people, or expresses extreme jealousy and anger if they do.
        * **Impersonation/Sabotage:** Sending messages from the victim's account to their contacts (impersonating the victim) to create conflict or drive others away, or deleting/blocking contacts.
        * **Controlling Device Access:** Limiting when and how the victim can use their phone or computer, or confiscating devices.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Forbidding Contact:** "Why are you still talking to [friend's name]? I don't trust them. Block them now or there will be consequences."
        * **Impersonation/Sabotage:** (Perpetrator sends from victim's phone to a friend) "Don't bother texting me again, I don't want to be friends with you anymore." (Victim is unaware).

    * **Usage:**
        * **Excessive Messaging/Calling:** Sending a relentless stream of messages, calls, or voicemails, often escalating in tone, especially if the victim doesn't respond immediately.
        * **Threats and Intimidation:** Delivering explicit or implicit threats of physical harm, self-harm, or damage to the victim's reputation or property.
        * **Spreading Rumors/Defamation:** Posting or sharing private or embarrassing information about the victim online to shame, humiliate, or damage their social standing.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Excessive Messaging/Calling:** (Dozens of messages in quick succession) "ANSWER ME! WHERE ARE YOU? You're ignoring me. I know what you're doing. You'll regret this."

        * **Spreading Rumors/Defamation:** "You think you're so innocent? Wait until everyone sees this photo/story I have about you."

4. Gaslighting (Amplified Digitally)
    * **Definition:** While a general toxic behavior, in CIPV via chat, it's intensely used to make the victim doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity regarding online interactions, often by denying or manipulating digital evidence.
    * **Motivation:** To **control the victim's reality and erode their self-trust and confidence**, making them more susceptible to the perpetrator's narratives and less likely to challenge the abuse. It's a profound form of psychological manipulation.
    * **Usage:**
        * **Denying Sent Messages:** The perpetrator claims they never sent a specific message or deny the content of a message, even when the victim has screenshots.
        * **Fabricating or Altering Chats:** Creating fake screenshots or altering messages to "prove" the victim is lying or behaving badly.
        * **Distorting Past Events:** Changing the narrative of past online conversations, making the victim believe they misremembered or misunderstood.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Denying Sent Messages:** Victim: "You sent me that message saying [abusive statement]." Perpetrator: "I never said that, you're making things up! You're crazy." (Even if the victim has a screenshot).
        * **Fabricating or Altering Chats:** "Look, I have a screenshot right here where *you* said [something you didn't say/was altered], so don't lie to me."

5. Coercion and Demands
    * **Definition:** Using threats, intimidation, or emotional blackmail via chat to force the victim into specific actions, often against their will or better judgment.

        * **Demanding Compliance:** Ordering the victim to send specific photos, share personal information, or act in a certain way online.
        * **Threats of Exposure:** Threatening to expose private photos, messages, or information if the victim doesn't comply.
        * **Emotional Blackmail:** Using guilt, love, or threats of self-harm to pressure the victim.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Demanding Compliance:** "Send me a photo of yourself right now to prove where you are." or "Post this message on your social media saying how much you love me, or else."
        * **Threats of Exposure:** "If you don't answer my calls, I'm going to send that video to all your family."
        * **Emotional Blackmail:** "If you really loved me, you'd send me that picture. You're breaking my heart if you don't trust me."

## Key Behaviours of Healthy Chat Conversations in Cyber Intimate Partner Violence

1. Respect for Autonomy and Privacy
    * **Definition:** This means acknowledging and valuing your partner's right to independent thought, action, and private life, both online and offline. It involves trusting your partner without demanding constant oversight or access to their personal digital spaces.
    * **Motivation:** This is fundamental because it fosters a relationship built on **trust, respect, and individual freedom**. It allows both partners to feel secure, valued as separate individuals, and not constantly under surveillance or suspicion. It's the direct opposite of the pervasive control seen in CIPV.
    * **Usage:** It's demonstrated by not demanding access to personal devices or accounts, respecting their right to communicate with others freely, and trusting their whereabouts without needing constant digital proof.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Trusting Independence:** Your partner mentions going out with friends; you respond, "Have fun! Text me when you get home safely," without demanding photos or real-time location updates.
        * **Respecting Digital Boundaries:** Your partner leaves their phone unlocked; you don't scroll through their messages or apps without explicit permission.
        * **Valuing Private Space:** You don't bombard your partner with messages if they're offline or busy, understanding they have their own activities and needing personal space.

2. Supportive Connection, Not Isolation
    * **Definition:** This involves actively encouraging and celebrating your partner's relationships with friends, family, and other social connections. It means facilitating, rather than hindering, their digital interactions with their support network.
    * **Motivation:** Healthy relationships thrive on robust external support systems. This aspect builds **resilience for both individuals and the relationship itself**, ensuring that neither partner feels solely dependent on the other for emotional needs. It directly counteracts the isolation tactics of CIPV.
    * **Usage:** It's shown by expressing genuine interest in their interactions with others, encouraging them to connect with friends and family, and never interfering with their communication.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Encouraging Social Bonds:** Your partner texts, "My friend invited me to an online game night." You reply, "That sounds great! You should definitely go, you deserve some fun time with friends."
        * **Positive Reinforcement of Connections:** "It's awesome that you reconnected with your cousin on social media, I know you really missed them."
        * **Never Intervening:** You see your partner chatting with someone you don't know, but you trust them and don't question, accuse, or demand to see the conversation.

3. Safety and Security (Absence of Harassment or Threats)
    * **Definition:** This means that all chat communication is free from any form of harassment, intimidation, threats (physical, emotional, or digital), or fear-inducing content. Messages foster a sense of psychological and emotional safety.
    * **Motivation:** Safety is paramount in any healthy relationship. The absence of these behaviors creates a foundation of **security and trust**, allowing both partners to express themselves openly without fear of reprisal, public humiliation, or digital targeting. This is the direct antithesis of cyber stalking and online threats in CIPV.
    * **Usage:** It's evident when messages are consistently respectful, disagreements remain focused on issues rather than personal attacks, and there are no veiled or overt threats of harm, exposure, or digital sabotage.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Respectful Disagreement:** "I understand your perspective, but I don't agree with that approach. Can we talk about it more calmly?" (Instead of: "You're wrong and stupid if you think that.")
        * **Reassurance Instead of Threats:** If a disagreement arises, responding, "Let's take a break and come back to this when we're both calmer. I want to resolve this, not escalate it."
        * **No Shame or Exposure:** Respecting shared private moments and ensuring no personal information or images are ever used as leverage or shared without explicit consent.

4. Validation and Reality-Testing (Opposite of Gaslighting)
    * **Definition:** This involves affirming your partner's experiences, feelings, and perceptions, even if you don't fully agree. It means supporting their sense of reality and memory, especially concerning past conversations.
    * **Motivation:** This is crucial for maintaining **mental well-being and a strong sense of self** for both partners. It prevents the psychological damage caused by gaslighting, fostering an environment where individuals feel confident in their own minds and perceptions.
    * **Usage:** It's practiced by acknowledging their feelings, not denying past events or messages, and seeking clarity rather than twisting facts.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Affirming Feelings:** Partner: "I feel really down about that comment I got online." You: "That's completely understandable. It's valid to feel hurt by something like that."
        * **Acknowledging Shared History:** Partner: "Remember when we talked about this last Tuesday?" You: "Yes, I remember. We discussed X. What about it?" (Instead of: "No, we never talked about that, you're making it up.")
        * **Seeking Clarity:** "I thought I said X, but if you heard Y, let's look at the chat history so we can both be clear."

5. Genuine Collaboration and Consent (Absence of Coercion)
    * **Definition:** This means that all decisions and shared actions are based on mutual agreement and freely given consent, without any element of pressure, manipulation, or digital coercion.
    * **Motivation:** This upholds the fundamental principle of **equal partnership and agency**. It ensures that actions taken are truly desired by both individuals, fostering a relationship built on mutual respect and shared decision-making, rather than one-sided demands.
    * **Usage:** It's demonstrated by asking, not demanding; respecting "no" as a complete answer; and discussing decisions rather than issuing ultimatums.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Seeking Consent:** "Would you be comfortable sending me a photo of that view?" (Instead of: "Send me a photo right now!")
        * **Respecting "No":** Partner: "I don't really want to post that online." You: "Okay, no problem at all. Your comfort comes first." (Instead of: "Why not? You have to!")
        * **Collaborative Decision-Making:** "What do you think about us both posting a photo together to celebrate our anniversary?" (Instead of: "You *will* post a photo of us today.")

## Neutral behaviours

1. **Definition:** Neutral behaviors are actions or responses that do not significantly impact the emotional tone or dynamics of the conversation. They are often factual, straightforward, and devoid of strong emotional content.
2. **Motivation:** These behaviors can help to de-escalate tension, provide clarity, or simply keep the conversation on track without introducing new emotional elements.
